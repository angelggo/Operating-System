# Basic information about Team and Project (Deliverables Part 1)
    >Team members: 
        Angel Gabriel Gomez Ortega
    >Project Title: 
        OS Emulator
    >Project Scoap:
        Welcome to SimpleOS Simulator! This is a lightweight C++ program that emulates 
        some of the core functions of an operating system. Itâ€™s a great way to get hands-on 
        experience with OS concepts like process scheduling, memory management, and file 
        operationsâ€”without diving into complex real-world kernels.
    >Instructions for setting up and running the Initial Progra:
        ðŸ”¹Windows Instructions:



# Future features:
    ðŸ”¹ Process Management â€“ Support process creation, scheduling (First-Come, First-Served & Round Robin), and termination.
    ðŸ”¹ Memory Management â€“ Simulate a basic paging system with memory allocation and deallocation.
    ðŸ”¹ File System Simulation â€“ Perform simple file operations like reading, writing, and managing directories.
    ðŸ”¹ Command-Line Interface (CLI) â€“ Use basic shell-like commands to interact with the simulated OS.


# Technology Used(Subject to change):
    ðŸ”¹ C++ (FLTK for GUI support)
    ðŸ”¹ CMake for easy cross-platform builds
    ðŸ”¹ MinGW/GCC for Windows, Clang/GCC for macOS/Linux
